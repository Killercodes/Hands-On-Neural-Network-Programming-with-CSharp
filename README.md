## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
m_va.Copy(vtmp, m_bestVectors[i])
m_va.Sub(vtmp, particlePosition);
m_va.MulRand(vtmp, m_c1);
m_va.Add(m_velocities[i], vtmp);
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, Deep Learning Aspirants and Data Analysts who are now looking to move into advanced machine learning and deep learning with C#.
